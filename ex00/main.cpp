// For every exercise, you have to provide the most complete tests you can.
// Constructors and destructors of each class must display specific messages. Don’t use the
// same message for all classes.
// Start by implementing a simple base class called Animal. It has one protected
// attribute:
// • std::string type;
// Implement a Dog class that inherits from Animal.
// Implement a Cat class that inherits from Animal.
// These two derived classes must set their type field depending on their name. Then,
// the Dog’s type will be initialized to "Dog", and the Cat’s type will be initialized to "Cat".
// The type of the Animal class can be left empty or set to the value of your choice.
// Every animal must be able to use the member function:
// makeSound()
// It will print an appropriate sound (cats don’t bark).
// 8
// C++ - Module 04 Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces
// Running this code should print the specific sounds of the Dog and Cat classes, not
// the Animal’s.

// To ensure you understood how it works, implement a WrongCat class that inherits
// from a WrongAnimal class. If you replace the Animal and the Cat by the wrong ones
// in the code above, the WrongCat should output the WrongAnimal sound.
// Implement and turn in more tests than the ones given above.
